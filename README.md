# Employee Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Welcome to the Employee Churn Prediction project! In this project, we utilized the power of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict whether an employee would leave their job or not. 

## Dataset
We worked with the churn dataset. This dataset served as the foundation for training my ANN model.

## Approach
Our aim was to develop an accurate prediction model for employee churn. Through a rigorous training process, we fine-tuned the model to accurately classify whether an employee is likely to leave the organization.

## Model Performance
After training the ANN model on the churn dataset, I achieved an impressive accuracy of around 86%. This demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in accurately predicting employee churn.
